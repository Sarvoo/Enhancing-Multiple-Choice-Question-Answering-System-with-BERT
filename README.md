# Enhancing Multiple-Choice Question Answering System with BERT

Implemented and Fine-Tuned a BERT-based model to significantly improve the accuracy of multiple-choice question answering systems, achieving a test set accuracy of 77.6%.

Transformed Dataset by structuring question-option pairs to maximize compatibility with BERT, enhancing model understanding and processing efficiency.

Utilized Advanced Techniques from the Hugging Face transformers library to fine-tune the BERT model, optimizing for high performance and accuracy.

Employed Cosine Similarity Analysis to measure and analyze the semantic similarities between question and option pairs, enhancing the model’s ability to discern correct answers.

Utilized Set Similarity Measures such as overlap coefficient, Sorensen-Dice & Jaccard similarity to evaluate and improve the alignment between questions and their respective options, further refining the model’s predictive accuracy.

Achieved High Precision and recall metrics on the training and validation sets, with a training accuracy of 85.5% and validation accuracy of 79.1%, demonstrating robust model training and evaluation.
